üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Fitness Challenge App ‚Äì Project Overview
The Fitness Challenge App is a Python-based console application designed to help users monitor and improve their health. It calculates the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) using height and weight inputs, classifies their fitness level (Underweight, Fit, or Overweight), and suggests personalized challenges accordingly.

Users can:
Set monthly weight gain/loss goals,

Choose from tailored fitness or wellness challenges,

Track progress across a simulated 30-day period,

Receive motivational feedback based on consistency.

üêç Python Concepts Used:
Functions: calculate_bmi(), classify_bmi() for modular code.

Conditional Statements: if-elif-else for logic flow and user classification.

User Input: input() to collect user data and preferences.

Type Casting: int(), float() for numeric processing.

String Formatting: f-strings for clean output.

Lists: Used for motivational messages.

Control Flow: Nested conditions for task tracking and motivation.

The app emphasizes interactive goal setting, progress tracking, and health education, making it a great foundational project for beginners in health-tech development.
